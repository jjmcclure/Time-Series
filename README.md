1. Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?
There was no information provided in this exercise that would convince me to buy the yen and against the dollar.
2. Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?
According to the volitility forecast holding yen will get riskier.
3. Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?
I would not feel confident using the models from the time-series analysis.  The P values are well over 0.05.

# Regression Analysis
Based on the graph I would not be happy using this analysis for investing purposes.  It appears to mostly not track together.
